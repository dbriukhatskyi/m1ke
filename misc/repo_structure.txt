=========

\working_dir - directory under source control
\some_directory, file1, file2, ... - directory structure and files under source control

[hash] - calculated hash of a file used as file name
0.gzip - the very first appeared file with such checksum
1.gzip - just in case we have different files with the same checksum

active_branch.txt - file containing the name of the active branch
[branch_name] - file containing the id of the latest commit

[commit_id] - some file (probably XML/JSON/...?) containing the following data:
			* previous commit id
			* directory state as of time of this commit
		  commit_id - calculated commit unique identifier (say, timestamp-based like 20160514121101456789)
